# Geoapify Challenge

## Purpose

- Create a Weather Database and use random sampling by utilizing the "np.random.uniform" function to generate a new set of latitudes and longitudes. We then input OpenWeatherMap's API key to retrieve latitude and longitude, maximum temperature, percent humidity, percent cloudiness, wind speed, and weather description. After creating a DataFrame we create an output file and export it into a csv. 
- Using the info created from the Weather Database we import the Geoapify API to create our Vacation Search folder and file. We create a new DataFrame that has the weather information as well as hotels based on our search parameters (min and max temp). We then clean the data and create a map with the city names, max temp, and weather description.
